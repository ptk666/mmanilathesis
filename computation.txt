ex.

maxpax = 30
constplayer = 8,000
maxpax - 8 = player (22)
player * 500 = (11,000) + constplayer = totalAmount (19,000)
totalAmount / 2 = downpayment (9,500)

maxpax = 30
constplayer = 8,000
perHead = 500
maxpax - 8 = player (22)
player * 500 = (11,000) + constplayer = totalAmount (19,000)
total amount(19,000)*0.12 =(20280) totalamountwithVAT
totalAmountwithVAT / 2 = downpayment (10,140)
